# **SIMPLE HANGMAN GAME**

This game was created together with my friend in C Progamming Language during our first year in university for a programming class.  
  
This game was intended as a project to apply and implement things that we have learnt during our class. The game uses a gfx library that was given by our lecturer. The game was also made in Linux.  
  
## **Installation**
  
The program uses a gfx library that runs on Linux machines using the X11 Window System. I am not sure if this will run on Windows or Mac, but I have heard that it is possible.

To compile the program use the following command:

`gcc HANGMAN.c gfx.c -o hangman.o -lX11 -lm`

To run the program use the following command:

`./hangman.o`

## **Credits**  
This project would have not been possible without the help of my lecturers and coursemate. I would like to give special thanks to my teammate Fathi Hilmi as we both work on this project together.
